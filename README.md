## Why Trash Post in Block Editor?

This plugin provides a quick way to __delete__ or __trash__ a Post from __within__ the __Block Editor__. Previously, the only way to achieve this required a user to exit the article or post before deleting. Not anymore! Now, from the comfort of your Block Editor, you could easily delete the Post you're working on with ease.
